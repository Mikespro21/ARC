# Crowdlike — Option A (Pure Streamlit, High-Fidelity)

This is a pure Streamlit rebuild (no React, no Node) styled to closely match the original UI:
- Blue → white → purple background gradient
- Rounded glassy cards
- Hover-reveal sidebar (move your mouse to the left edge to reveal it)

## Run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Deploy (Streamlit Community Cloud)
- Entry point: `app.py`
- No Node/npm required
